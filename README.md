# Crystal Planet

Crystal Planet is a casual accelerometer controlled game primarily for Android where you drive a hovercraft at high speed. The goal is to avoid collisions with huge crystals, thus fly as long as possible.

The game has been made as a code example, though I've done my best to polish it on the visual and gameplay side as well.
